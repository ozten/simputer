# simputer

Simulation(s) and Labrator(ies) of computer(s).

Browser based simulations of various layers of digital computers, such as:

* transistors
* CPUs
* RAM
* Disk

As well as labratories which visualize these simulations.

## Status

This project will probably never be finished.
A scratchpad to think about the foundations of digital computing.

## Goal

Maybe a specific CPU or Computer?
A bottom up exploration for now.

## Architecture

The can be many architectures,
but a way to make sense of these simulations is as follows:

* ???
* ???
* Transistor
