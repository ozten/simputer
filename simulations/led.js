LED - A light-emitting diode (LED) is a semiconductor light source.
LEDs are used as indicator lamps in many devices and are increasingly
used for general lighting.

Appearing as practical electronic components in 1962, early LEDs emitted
low-intensity red light, but modern versions are available across the visible,
ultraviolet, and infrared wavelengths, with very high brightness.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Led

Mainly used in simulations to give visual feedback.

Usage:

    var led1 = new LED({domId: 'led1', color:'red'});
    var in = led1.getInputFn();
    in(1);
    in(0);

Simulation Notes:
Input is modeled as a function which is hooked up as a callback.

This will create a new LED, which will start rendering itself
